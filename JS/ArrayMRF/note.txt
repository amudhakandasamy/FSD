MRF in javascript 

map()

	map() iterates each value in array,
	A Map is an iterable, so it can be directly iterated.

filter()

	The filter() method of Iterator instances returns a new iterator helper 	object that yields only those elements of the iterator for which the 	provided callback function returns true.

reduce()

	The reduce() method of Array instances executes a user-supplied "reducer" 	callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the 	return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final 	result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single 	value.

	The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the 	previous calculation". If supplied, an initial value may be used in its 	place. Otherwise the array element at index 0 is used as the initial value 	and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).
